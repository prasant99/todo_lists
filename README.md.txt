#To-do List Application V1

## What it does
A simple command-line to-do list where you can add tasks, view all tasks, and save them to a file. Tasks persist between sessions.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Tasks are saved to a text file (tasks.txt)
- Error handling for missing files

## What I learned
- File handling (reading and writing)
- Using `with` statement for file operations
- Error handling with try/except
- Working with lists and loops
- Building a menu-driven program

## Future improvements
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete specific tasks
